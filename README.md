And it’s a visual delight too – a beautiful array of long-grained , tender  and pungent spices studded with fresh mint and coriander, topped with fried onions and boiled  wedges.  is a good quality protein and when combined with , herbs, spices and yogurt, it makes a healthy and  one pot meal – like every classic  dum biryani should be.
