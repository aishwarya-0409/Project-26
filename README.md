<h2>Chicken Biryani Recipe Card

In India, the eternal favourite for a special Sunday lunch or a party dish is definitely a perfectly layered Chicken Biryani, dum cooked to perfection! And it’s a visual delight too – a beautiful array of long-grained rice, tender chicken and pungent spices studded with fresh mint and coriander, topped with fried onions and boiled egg wedges. Chicken is a good quality protein and when combined with rice, herbs, spices and yogurt, it makes a healthy and filling one pot meal – like every classic chicken dum biryani should be. Just serve it piping hot essentially with a raita and salad or kachumber and wait for all the praises coming your way! I would also suggest trying out this recipe of Brown Rice Biryani with Chutney Chicken.
